## Smart XML Analyzer

Analyzes HTML and finds a specific element, even after changes, using a set of extracted attributes. 

Usage: sbt run "Main [input_origin_file_path] [input_other_sample_file_path]" 

This first version only takes into account the classes of the original element, the tag name and the number of attributes.
